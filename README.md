# Introduction

Welcome to our Interactive Music Instrument project showcase! We're excited to share this fun and creative project with you. This interactive experience allows you to explore and play various music instruments on the screen. Click on different parts of the instruments to produce their unique sounds. It's a perfect blend of music and technology, designed to provide a delightful and immersive user experience.

# Project Description: 

In this project, we've developed a web-based interactive application that lets users interact with a range of musical instruments. You can play the guitar and drums, and enjoy the feel of a rock band on your web browser. Each instrument is visually represented on the screen, and you can simply click on different parts to trigger sounds associated with that specific area of the instrument. Whether you're a music enthusiast or just looking for a creative way to pass the time, our project offers something for everyone.
